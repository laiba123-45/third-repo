<p>There are several ways to open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code:
Using the Menu Bar:
Navigate to View in the top menu bar.
Select Terminal from the dropdown menu.
Using the Keyboard Shortcut:
Press `Ctrl + ` (backtick key, typically found under the Esc key) on your keyboard. This shortcut also toggles the terminal's visibility (minimizes/restores it).</p>
